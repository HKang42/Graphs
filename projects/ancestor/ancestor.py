Write a function that, 
    given the dataset and the ID of an individual in the dataset, 
    returns their earliest known ancestor â€“ the one at the farthest distance from the input individual. 
    If there is more than one ancestor tied for "earliest", return the one with the lowest numeric ID.

Generate the graph using the parent-child pairs from the dataset.

#   if the parents exists, then we use them as keys (i.e. are they children to anyone) and find their parents
#   repeat this process until we have exhausted the nodes.
